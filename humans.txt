# INSPIRATION

    CV'S are _meant to be_ 2-3 pages long yet nobody seems to print them these days. 
    
    After learning to use Scribus (https://www.scribus.net) to create a pixel perfect 
    CV it was too much hassle to maintain and integrate basic text proofing tools. 
    
    Turns out Markdown can generate decent print documents. Now this repository is 
    the source of both the responsive site and a PDF print version using the Print to 
    PDF feature directly from MacDown. 

    GitHub also provides basic analytics.
