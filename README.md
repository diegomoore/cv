**Mibstar Ventures** üìç London ‚è≥ 2016 ‚Äì Present

A boutique Technology Consultancy, Mibstar Ventures
My personal Venture Building vessel I've established to capture on-going collaborations in start- up capacity over the years some of which are stealth or incubation phase.

Previous projects below

### Director of Backend Development ![monks](assets/logos/monks-technology-services.svg "Monks Technology Services logo")

**Monks Technology Services** *(formerly Zemoga)* üìç  Bogot√° / Remote ‚è≥ Sep 2019 ‚Äì Jun 2024 

Returned to Zemoga (now Monks Technology Services) to re-establish the strength of the backend development practice. I was part of the pitch team for their largest opportunity in their then 17 year history, a ramp-up of 150 team members for Morningstar to nearshore their offshore dependency with China.

This coincided across the company with increased complexity in engineering projects and a particular focus in the FinTech sector and the associated due diligence and standards such as ISO certification requirements.

**Highlights & Accomplishments:**

* Growing the backend development team from 7 to 57 engineers in less than 3 years and all the associated processes and team structure to support the scale.
* In collaboration with my VP we established an additional DevOps Discipline and increased the awareness and skills across disciplines to respond to the demand of Serverless solutions and Native Cloud Engineers.
* Expanded the offering of skills beyond .Net, Java & PHP to include SalesForce, full-stack engineers, Python, data engineers and even clients in the Web3 / crypto space.

**Mibstar Ventures** üìç London ‚è≥ Jun 2016 ‚Äì Sep 2018

Having been empowered with my experience at Seth Godin‚Äôs AltMBA I pivoted Mibstar (formally Mibstar Technologies) to focus on Ventures where I‚Äôm able to apply my experience and passion for building digital products in start-up environments.

The variety of the ventures is indicative of the importance of spending time on projects I have an affinity towards. Some of them I‚Äôve been able to help ship include:

* **Venture Building** ‚Äì FinTechnovation incubators Providing Venture Builder & Consulting Services to a group 5 incubators from Surrey Incubation & The Surrey 100 Club. All under the auspices of the FinTechnovation Group.

* ![compassion](assets/logos/compassion.svg "Compassion logo") ‚Äì Engaged with the charity ahead of building their first mobile app. My initial review led to recommending a project pause to reassess underlying assumptions. Facilitated workshops with the Digital Team, Directors, and International Team. Together, we mapped missing objectives and developed a concept supporting Digital as an additional channel to increase touch-points between sponsors, the charity, and sponsored children.

* **Diagri** ‚Äì Internet of Things / Mobile Web App An Internet of Things (IoT) start-up providing smart monitoring solutions for livestock; tracking and detailing animal location and movement.

I was brought in to bolster the Technology team of this independent UX and Design agency, which was increasing their Financial Sector clients as well as expanding to larger and more complex projects.This required some insight and experience throughout from the pitch process all the way to implementation. Leading and expanding the relatively young team from front-end prototyping projects to full implementation of transactional e-commerce sites with associated integrations.

Establishing modern development practices, leveraging new tooling (Atlassian, AWS & fortrabbit), frameworks (Laravel & Drupal 8) and working collaboratively with client-side Architects (esure).

<blockquote>A very difficult challenge is to find a senior technologist that can lead a team within a creative culture. If you see Diego for the first time you would think he's an artist, but behind his coolness lies technical genius...or technical creative genius I must say. I witnessed first hand how he successfully managed to deliver high quality projects during high stress circumstances for high level global brands. He proved effective integration with visual design and UI development distributed teams while manoeuvring ever changing client requirements...all without loosing sight of his integrity and leadership character. <br><br>

If you are looking for technical creative genius, I strongly suggest you don't waste the opportunity to have Diego on your team. <br>

<blockquote>Diego is the technologist that you want on your team. I've forever been impressed with his dedication, quick (and correct) decision making, dedication to his work and team. To manage development with very short to long timelines, you need someone with the high level of discipline and care that Diego brings to the table. He handles rapidly changing requirements with the level of agility that is required, yet is also keen on making sure that everything is well considered before moving forward. <br><br>
Of all the managers I've hired over the years, Diego will always be in the top of the list, and I enjoy watching him advance as time goes on.<br><br>

### Application & Systems Architect ![parliament](assets/logos/parliament.svg "UK Parliament logo")

**UK Parliament** üìç Westminster ‚è≥ 2010 ‚Äì 2011

Joined a large in-house Applications & Development department which was running a ¬£8m
Procedural Data programme to upgrade bespoke business critical systems which support both
Houses (the House of Commons and the House of Lords) with many ASPNet MVC, WPF and
underlying RESTFul Web Services.

One of the key objectives of this Procedural Data programme was to enrich data closer to the source in order to publish it in digital form in-line with cost saving exercise to reduce multi-million print contracts.

As such I was responsible for defining, presenting and getting approval of the Product & Solution options papers and their subsequent High Level Designs through the Enterprise Architecture Board. This included the data schema definitions for core data (People, Parliamentary Questions, Written Statements, etc) that would be published on [data.parliament.uk](http://data.parliament.uk)

### Technical Director ![eurekastep](assets/logos/eurekastep.png "EurekaStep logo")

**EurekaStep** üìç London ‚è≥ Apr 2006 ‚Äì Mar 2010

Strengthened and developed a more in-depth technical service offering into this Digital Media Agency to compliment the growing and expanding client requirements. Leveraging in-house skills and near-shore partners using both off-the-shelf products and bespoke development depending on suitability.

**Key Clients:** ![](assets/key-clients/eurekastep.svg "Key Clients")

#### Recomendation:
>  It's been a long hard slog, but sheer guts, determination and proven commercial results have helped Diego to become one of the greatest technical architect's in the business. He's an amazing visionary and I've lost count of the amount of times he's been pipped to the post on technical ideas he's been working on by the heady crew at either the BBC or Apple! For those who have money to invest wisely, he has a clarity of vision and sparkling understanding that would make even some of the great whites stand up and take notice.

> **Warren Wysocki** ‚Äî Managing Director, EurekaStep


### Web Applications Developer (2003) > IT Manager (2004) ![eurekastep](assets/logos/eurekastep.png "EurekaStep logo")

**EurekaStep** üìç Horsham ‚è≥ Aug 2003 ‚Äì Mar 2006

Balanced inward facing responsibilities of Managing IT alongside the increasingly more important outward responsibilities to ensure the IT needs of clients and their projects were being met for web application projects.

**Key Clients:** ![](assets/key-clients/eurekastep2.svg "Key Clients")

#### Recomendation:
> When carrying delivery and commercial responsibility for blue chip client engagements, bleeding edge/emergent technologies are typically seen as being a high risk proposition. 
> 
> Having worked with Diego (2001-2008) on the successful sale and delivery of many ‚Äònever been done before‚Äô projects, as our Technical Director he carried a maturity and realism as to which technological boundaries should be pushed. 
> 
> Selling technology solutions to large scale established organisations where they would be seen as early adopters, or even the industry test cases, became the norm and that drive for innovation brought an exciting, highly rewarding (and often challenging) market differentiation to our business model. 
> 
> Having worked in a Tier 1 IT company for the last 3 years, I can see that Diego‚Äôs ideas and technologies are now viewed as foundational for the next generation ICT delivery model. Concepts such as Open Source, Cloud Computing, Software as a Service, Collaboration etc are being grasped for the cost savings that they can realise in a challenging economic environment, particularly by the Public Sector. 
> 
> I would highly recommend Diego as an innovator who will always be driven to be one step ahead of the market. The wise move is to invest in his ideas.
>
> **Iain McKay** ‚Äî Chief Operating Officer (COO), EurekaStep

### Web Developer
**Digital Media & Motion** ‚è≥ Sep 2001 ‚Äì Aug 2003

#### Recomendation:
> Diego is an extremely capable and dependable problem-solver and has wide-ranging experience in the delivery of technical solutions over the Internet.
